Situation:
	At Tech Mahindra, I was responsible for managing the deployment of multiple microservices across different environments, while coordinating between
	    internal teams and the client. The project required smooth communication, timely updates, and error-free deployments to meet client expectations.
Task:
	I needed to ensure all deployments were completed on schedule, maintain coordination across multiple teams, provide leadership for my own team, and act as the
	    point of contact for status updates in the absence of the scrum master.
Action:
	Led my team by distributing tasks effectively and providing end-of-day updates to the scrum master.
	Coordinated with different internal teams and facilitated cross-team calls to track the status of all service deployments.
	Worked closely with the client to ensure successful deployments in all environments.
	Took initiative to provide updates to lead scrum managers when our scrum master was unavailable, ensuring continuity of communication and reporting.
	Maintained alignment between technical teams and client expectations through proactive status tracking and problem resolution.
Result:
	Successfully deployed all microservices across the required environments without critical issues.
	Streamlined communication between teams and the client, which reduced deployment delays and improved transparency.
	As a result, we were able to complete the deployments on schedule with minimal issues, and the client and leadership gave very positive feedback.
    I also learned the importance of proactive communication and structured coordination in complex multi-team projects.
    Received excellent feedback from both internal leadership and the client upon leaving the company, highlighting effective leadership and coordination.
