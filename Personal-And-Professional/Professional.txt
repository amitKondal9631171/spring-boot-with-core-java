My name is Amit Kondal. I completed my B.Tech in Computer Science from Guru Nanak Dev University, Amritsar.

I began my career at Bayatree Infocom Pvt. Ltd. as a Software Engineer, where I worked extensively on core Java, multithreading, and database migration.
    My responsibilities included understanding client requirements, implementing features, handling deployments, and preparing technical documentation.

After that, I moved to Fintek Software Services as a Senior Software Engineer in the trade and finance domain.
    Since it was a smaller organization, I gained strong end-to-end requirement analysis, design, development, and delivery.
    I also strengthened my experience with the Spring ecosystem.

My next role was at Tech Mahindra as a Tech Lead in the banking domain. Here, I worked closely with clients and various cross-functional teams.
    I gained hands-on experience with microservices architecture and tools like OpenShift, Jenkins, Kibana, and Datadog.
    I was responsible for leading development and helping deploy applications in cloud environments.

Currently, I’m working at Capgemini India as a Senior Consultant, again in the banking domain.
    I work directly with clients and the architecture team, gather and refine requirements, design and implement solutions, and support junior team members.
    I’ve also expanded my experience in microservices and Azure cloud.

Overall, I bring strong end-to-end exposure across monolithic, modular, scalable, distributed & concurrent microservices, with experience leading development.
