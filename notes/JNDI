JNDI: Java Namespace Directory Interface:

1. The most common use case is to set up a database connection pool on a Java EE application server.
2. Provide Database credentials in server (Webserver like tomcat or JBoss) configuration file.
3. Configure the DB Connection name in J2EE application context file (e.g. <jee:jndilookup>)

This has several advantages:
    If you have a deployment sequence where apps move from devl->int->test->prod
        environments, you can use the same JNDI name in each environment and hide
        the actual database being used. Applications don't have to change as they
        migrate between environments.
    You can minimize the number of folks who need to know the credentials for accessing
        a production database. Only the Java EE app server needs to know if you use JNDI.
