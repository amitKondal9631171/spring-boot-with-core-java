@Transaction is enough to handle transactions or what else is required ?
    What @Transactional Does
        In Spring (and JEE too), putting @Transactional on a method/class:
        Starts a transaction before method execution.
        Commits transaction if method completes successfully.
        Rolls back transaction if an unchecked exception (RuntimeException) occurs.
