Recall that hash codes are not unique.
The only requirement as per Java documentation is for hash codes of equal objects to be the same.
        System.out.println("Aa hash code: " + "Aa".hashCode()); //2112
        System.out.println("BB hash code: " + "BB".hashCode()); //2112

If two strings hashCode() is equal, it does not mean they are equal.
If equals() is true for two strings, their hashCode() will be the same.
