What is Semantic Versioning?
    Semantic versioning is a system for numbering software versions so you can understand compatibility and changes at a glance.
    MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH → 2.5.1
        MAJOR → Incompatible API changes (breaks backward compatibility).
        MINOR → New features added, backward-compatible.
        PATCH → Bug fixes, backward-compatible.
