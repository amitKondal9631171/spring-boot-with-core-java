How to achieve performance in Java?
    Minimise number of objects created:
        Avoid String Concatenation : Use StringBuffer.
        Avoid creating objects in Loops.
        Consider patterns like Flyweight. Flyweight pattern is primarily used to reduce the number
                 of objects created and to decrease memory footprint and increase performance.
    Use correct data structures.
    Reduce web application overhead:
        Small session size.
        Use Caching where appropriate.
        Close connections and Streams.
    Tune you database:
        Have indexes.
        Tune your queries.
        If you are using hibernate, understand the internals of hibernate. Avoid N+1 Selects Problem.
        Enable statistics on Databases.

What are the best practices in Load & Performance Testing?
    1) Have clear performance objectives. That’s the single most important objective.
        Decide Peak Load, Expected Response Time, Availability Required before hand.
    2) An application does not work on its own. It connects with a number of external
        interfaces. Establish clear performance expectations with the Interface Services
    3) Validate early : Do performance testing as early as possible.

What are the actions to reduce bottlenecks in an application?
    Introduce Caching.
    Tuning Java Code.
    Tuning Database. (Indexing, Optimizing Queries, Optimize Hibernate settings)
    Tuning Application Server Configuration and Settings (Connection, Memory, GC etc).
    Increase More Memory
