1.) What is a Lambda Expression, and why use them?
	It’s a function that can be referenced and shared as an object. Lambda Expressions require less coding.

What is a functional interface?
    A functional interface is an interface that contains just one abstract method.

How are functional interfaces and Lambda Expressions related ?
	Lambda expressions are applied only to the functional interface’s abstract method.

What is a stream, and how does it differ from a collection?
	A stream is an iterator whose function is to accept a set of actions and apply them to each of the elements it contains.

Java 17 is the latest LTS(Long Term Support) version of the Java programming language,
    released on September 14, 2021. If you're currently using Java 11, it may be time to
    consider migrating to Java 17 to take advantage of its new features and improvements.


 Java passes a copy of the value.
     The key question is: what is the value?
     For primitives → the value is the number itself
     For objects → the value is the reference (memory address)
     So Java is:
     pass-by-value, where the value might be a reference


In Java 8 and later, a HashMap converts its internal storage from a linked list to a Red-Black Tree within specific buckets to optimize performance when many keys collide at
    the same index.
    1. Performance Optimization (Worst-Case)
        The primary reason for this switch is to improve search time in heavily populated buckets.
        Linked List: Searching through a long linked list has a time complexity of O(n), meaning performance degrades linearly as the number of collisions increases.
        Red-Black Tree: A balanced binary search tree reduces this complexity to O(log n). This ensures that even in the case of extreme collisions, retrieval remains fast.
    2. Security Against DoS Attacks
        This change was largely security-driven to prevent Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks.
        The Threat: Attackers could intentionally craft keys (like specific HTTP headers) that produce identical hash codes.
        The Impact: In earlier versions of Java, this would force all entries into a single O(n) linked list, causing the CPU to spike during lookups and effectively crashing
                    the application. Using a tree mitigates this by maintaining a predictable O(log n) performance limit.
    3. Treeification Thresholds
        The conversion does not happen immediately because tree nodes are roughly twice the size of regular nodes and have more overhead for small amounts of data. It is
                triggered based on these constants:
        TREEIFY_THRESHOLD (8): A bucket is converted to a tree once it contains more than 8 elements.
        UNTREEIFY_THRESHOLD (6): If elements are removed and the count drops below 6, the tree is converted back into a linked list to save memory.
        MIN_TREEIFY_CAPACITY (64): The map will only treeify a bucket if the total number of buckets in the map is at least 64. If it's smaller, it will simply resize the
                                    map instead.
