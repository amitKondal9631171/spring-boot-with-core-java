I start off with the 4 Principles of Simple Design.
    Runs all tests
    Minimize Duplication
    Maximize Clarity / Readability
    Keep it Small
    Use of latest features

What are the modern programming practices which lead to very good applications?
    1) Unit Testing and Mocking
    2) Automated Integration Tests
    3) TDD -- PACT
    4) BDD: enable communication between the ready team (Business Analysts, Product Owner)
            and the done team (Developers, Testers, Operations).  (Given When Then)

What are the typical things you would need to consider while designing the Business Layer of a Java EE Web Application?
    1) Service layer acting as front of the application
    2) How to manage the transaction management
    3) Caching
    4) Does service layer need to handle all exceptions?
    5) Are there any Operations specific logging or auditing that is needed?
    6) Do we need to validate the data that is coming into the Business Layer?
    7) Testing

Designing the Access Layer (Data Layer) of the web application?
    1) Do we want to use a JPA based object mapping framework (Hibernate) or query based mapping framework.
    2) How do you handle connections to Database?
    3) Ensure that Performance and Scalability is taken care of in all the decisions you make.
    4) Testing
