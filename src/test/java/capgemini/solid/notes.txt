//SOLID Principal:

1. Single Responsibility Principle (SRP):
   A class should have one and only one reason to change.

2. Open/Closed Principle (OCP):
   Software entities (classes, modules, functions, etc.) should be open for extension, but closed for modification.

3. Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP):
   Objects in a program should be replaceable with instances of their subtypes without altering the correctness of that program.

4. Interface Segregation Principle (ISP):
   No client should be forced to depend on methods it does not use.
   example:
    interface University {
        void conductExams();
        void manageSports();
        void manageLibrary();
        void organizeCulturalEvents();
    }

    class EngineeringCollege implements University {
        public void conductExams() { System.out.println("Engineering exams"); }
        public void manageSports() { /* Not needed but must implement */ }
        public void manageLibrary() { System.out.println("Engineering library"); }
        public void organizeCulturalEvents() { /* Not needed but must implement */ }
    }
    Problems:
        EngineeringCollege is forced to implement sports and cultural events even if it doesn’t care.
        Violates ISP → clients are forced to depend on methods they don't use.
