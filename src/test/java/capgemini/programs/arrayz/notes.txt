Why is the complexity of fetching from an Array be O(1)?
    In an Array, objects are stored in continuous memory location.
    So, if you know the address of the base object then you will be able to find
    the address of the ith object.

How can you get the index of an array element? e.g. index of 10 from {4,2,3,5,6,10,12,32}
    You can find the index of an element through a linear or binary search.
        A linear search is a function in which you loop through each and every
        element of an array until it finds the match of the desired element.
        When it finds the matching element, it returns the index.
        Therefore time complexity of the linear search is O(n).
        Linear search can be applied to sorted as well as an unsorted array.

    If the array is sorted, you can use a binary search that repeatedly splits the
        array in half until the median of the interval matches the desired element
        and returns the index. Therefore time complexity of the binary search
        is O(log n)

Can a Negative number be passed in Array size?
    No, a negative number cannot be passed as array size. If you pass a negative number in
        Array size then you will get the NegativeArraySizeException at run time
