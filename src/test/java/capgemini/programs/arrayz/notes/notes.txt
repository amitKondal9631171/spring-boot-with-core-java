Arrays are contiguous in memory because of how they are designed at a low level in almost all programming languages, including Java, C, and C++.
1. Array is a fixed-size block
    When you create an array:
        int[] arr = new int[5];
        the JVM (or OS memory manager) allocates a single continuous block of memory large enough to store 5 integers in a row.

    Base Address → 1000
        int size    → 4 bytes

        Index  | Address
        -------|---------
        0      | 1000
        1      | 1004
        2      | 1008
        3      | 1012
        4      | 1016
    Fast random access
        Because of contiguous allocation, the address of any element can be calculated using this formula:
        address = base_address + (index * size_of_element)
        So accessing arr[3] is just one arithmetic calculation, making arrays O(1) for indexing.
    Efficiency
        Cache-friendly: CPUs fetch memory in blocks (cache lines), so consecutive elements are often preloaded.
        Low overhead: No extra pointers or object references for each element.
        Predictable: Memory layout stays the same until array resizing or deallocation.
    Why HashMap is different
        In a HashMap, the internal array of buckets is contiguous like an array, but the objects stored at those buckets (linked nodes or tree nodes) are scattered in heap memory because:
        Their number is dynamic.
        Linked structures need pointers to connect elements.

        | Feature          | **Array**             | **HashMap bucket chain**                   |
        | ---------------- | --------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
        | Memory layout    | Contiguous            | Non-contiguous                             |
        | Access time      | O(1) direct via index | O(1) for bucket + O(n) in worst-case chain |
        | Allocation       | Fixed size            | Dynamic allocation for nodes               |
        | Cache efficiency | High                  | Low to medium                              |
