What is a Regular Expression?
    A regular expression is a sequence of characters that forms a search pattern.
        When you search for data in a text, you can use this search pattern to
        describe what you are searching for.

    Regular expressions can be used to perform all types of text search
        and text replace operations.
    Java does not have a built-in Regular Expression class, but we can import the
        java.util.regex package to work with regular expressions. The package
        includes the following classes:

    Pattern Class - Defines a pattern (to be used in a search)
    Matcher Class - Used to search for the pattern
    PatternSyntaxException Class - Indicates syntax error in a regular expression pattern

[abc]	Find one character from the options between the brackets
[^abc]	Find one character NOT between the brackets
[0-9]	Find one character from the range 0 to 9
