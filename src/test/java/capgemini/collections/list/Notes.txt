Why is there no TreeList implementation of the List interface?
    Basically you need to understand what is the purpose of these implementation like both
        these TreeMap and Treeset are implementation of SortedSet and SortedMap is used for
        sorting purpose but we have Collections.sort(List) which can be implied on List for
        sorting hence not TreeList is not required in List.
    Because a list is an index-based data structure, and trees are no index-based data
        structures. That's the most basic and clear reason.
