ArrayDeque Works
    Internally: uses a resizable circular array (like a ring buffer).
    Operations are O(1) for adding/removing at both ends.
    Provides methods to work at front and rear.

| Feature           | `LinkedList`                            | `ArrayDeque`                 |
| ----------------- | --------------------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| **Performance**   | Slightly slower due to node allocations | Faster (array-based)         |
| **Memory**        | More overhead (object for each node)    | Compact array structure      |
| **Thread Safety** | No                                      | No                           |
| **Usage**         | General-purpose list/queue              | High-performance stack/queue |
