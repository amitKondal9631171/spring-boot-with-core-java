Collector take a stream of elements and fold them into a summary result: a collection, a map, a string, a single value… whatever shape you need.

Collector operations:
    1. Collect into collections
        toList() → puts elements into a List.
        toSet() → puts elements into a Set.
        toCollection(Supplier<C>) → lets you pick the exact collection type (e.g. LinkedList, TreeSet).

    2. Collect into maps
        toMap(keyMapper, valueMapper) → creates a Map<K,V>.
        toMap(keyMapper, valueMapper, mergeFunction) → resolves duplicate keys.
        toMap(keyMapper, valueMapper, mergeFunction, mapSupplier) → also controls the map type (e.g. LinkedHashMap).
        toConcurrentMap(...) → concurrent version for parallel streams.

    3. Grouping and partitioning
        groupingBy(classifier) → groups elements by a key into Map<K, List<T>>.
        groupingBy(classifier, downstream) → group and then apply another collector (like counting, summing).
        partitioningBy(predicate) → splits into two groups: true and false.
        partitioningBy(predicate, downstream) → partition with further reduction.

    4. Reductions & summaries
        counting() → counts number of elements.
        summingInt / summingLong / summingDouble → sum of a numeric field.
        averagingInt / averagingLong / averagingDouble → average of a numeric field.
        summarizingInt / summarizingLong / summarizingDouble → gives count, sum, min, max, average in one shot.

    5. String joining
        joining() → concatenates strings.
        joining(delimiter) → with delimiter.
        joining(delimiter, prefix, suffix) → also adds prefix/suffix.

    6. Find min/max
        minBy(comparator) → smallest element by comparator.
        maxBy(comparator) → largest element by comparator.

    7. Mapping / reducing inside collect
        mapping(mapper, downstream) → transform elements before passing to downstream collector.
        flatMapping(mapper, downstream) (added in Java 9, but handy to know).
        reducing(identity, mapper, accumulator) → general reduction.

    8. Special ones
        collectingAndThen(downstream, finisher) → run a finisher after collection. For example, collect into a list and then make it unmodifiable.
