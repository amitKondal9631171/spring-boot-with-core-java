Data Structures:
    Is the way of data organisation. Java supports multiple data types by default:
        Array
        List
        Stack
        Queue
        HashTable
        Trees
        Heaps
        Graphs

Space and Time complexity.

There are two types of Data Structures:-
    Primitive Data Structures
    Non-primitive Data Structures

Primitive data Structures:
    Are also called Primitive Data Types. byte, short,  int, float, char, boolean, long,
    and double are primitive Data types.

Non-primitive data Structures:
    Non-primitive Data Structures are of two types:-
        Linear Data Structures
        Non-linear Data Structures

Linear Data Structures – The elements arranged in a linear fashion are called Linear Data Structures.
                           Here, each element is connected to one other element only.
                           Linear Data Structures are as follows:
                               Arrays
                               Stack
                               Queue
                               Linked List
Non-Linear Data Structures – The elements arranged in a non-linear fashion are called Non-Linear
                             Data Structures. Here, each element is connected to n-other elements.
                             Trees
                                 Binary Tree
                                 Binary Search Tree
                                 AVL Tree
                                 Red-Black Tree
                             Graph
                             Heap
                                 MaxHeap
                                 MinHeap
                             Hash
                                 HashSet
                                 HashMap

Advantages of Data Structures in java
    Efficiency
    Re-usability
    Processing Speed
    Abstraction
    Data Searching

What is an Array?
    An array is the simplest data structure where a collection of similar data elements takes place
    and each data element can be accessed directly by only using its index number.
    Array Advantages:
        Random access
        Easy sorting and iteration
        Replacement of multiple variables
    Array Disadvantages:
        Size is fixed
        Difficult to insert and delete
        If capacity is more and occupancy less, most of the array gets wasted
        Needs contiguous memory to get allocated
    Applications
        For storing information in a linear fashion
        Suitable for applications that require frequent searching

What is Linked List?
    Linked list data structure helps the required objects to be arranged in a linear order.
    Advantages:
        Dynamic in size
        No wastage as capacity and size is always equal
        Easy insertion and deletion as 1 link manipulation is required
        Efficient memory allocation
    Disadvantages:
        If head Node is lost, the linked list is lost
        No random access is possible
    Applications:
        Suitable where memory is limited
        Suitable for applications that require frequent insertion and deletion

Features of Stack:
    Linear Data Structures using Java
        Follows LIFO: Last In First Out
        Only the top elements are available to be accessed
        Insertion and deletion takes place from the top
        Eg: a stack of plates, chairs, etc
        4 major operations:
        push(ele) – used to insert element at top
        pop() – removes the top element from stack
        isEmpty() – returns true is stack is empty
        peek() – to get the top element of the stack
        All operation works in constant time i.e, O(1)
    Advantages:
        Maintains data in a LIFO manner
        The last element is readily available for use
        All operations are of O(1) complexity
    Disadvantages:
        Manipulation is restricted to the top of the stack
        Not much flexible
    Applications:
        Recursion
        Parsing
        Browser
        Editors

Features of Queue
    Linear Data Structure
    Follows FIFO: First In First Out
    Insertion can take place from the rear end.
    Deletion can take place from the front end.
    Eg: queue at ticket counters, bus station
    4 major operations:
    enqueue(ele) – used to insert element at top
    dequeue() – removes the top element from queue
    peekfirst() – to get the first element of the queue
    peeklast() – to get the last element of the queue
    All operation works in constant time i.e, O(1)
    Advantages
        Maintains data in FIFO manner
        Insertion from beginning and deletion from end takes O(1) time
    Applications
        Scheduling
        Maintaining playlist

What is a Binary Tree?
    In a binary tree, the branches of the tree are made up of up to two child nodes for
    each node. The left and right nodes are the common names for the two youngsters.
    Child nodes make references to their parents, whereas parent nodes are nodes with children.

Features of Binary Tree
    Hierarchical  Data Structure
    The topmost element is known as the root of the tree
    Every Node can have at most 2 children in the binary tree
    Can access elements randomly using index
    Eg: Organisation hierarchy
    Common traversal methods:
        preorder(root) : print-left-right
        postorder(root) : left-right-print
        inorder(root) : left-print-right
    Advantages
        Can represent data with some relationship
        Insertion and search are much more efficient
    Disadvantages
        Sorting is difficult
        Not much flexible
