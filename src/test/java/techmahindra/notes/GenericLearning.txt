Methods forms the bases of object to object communication.
Hiding internal state and requiring all interaction to be performed through an object's methods is known as data encapsulation
 — a fundamental principle of object-oriented programming.

Object which has state and behaviour.

Object: In programming language a object is a unit of state and behaviour.
Dog: 
	state: color, height, name, breed, hungry at a time.
	behaviour: barking, running
Human:
	State: color, height, name
	behaviour: eating , sleeping, walking
Bicycles:
	state: current gear, speed, rpm
	behaviour: changing gear, blow horn, changing gear, applying breaks.

Class: prototype from which objects are created.

Package is a namespace that organizes set of classes and interfaces,
Primitive type do not share state with other primitive types
Integer literal is of type long if it ends with L otherwise it is of int type.
Floating type literal is of type float if it ends with F otherwise of double type optionally ends with D or d.
Literals: variables used to initialized without objects are called literals.
Array is container objects contains the fixed no. of objects.

lambda expression can be defined as a annonymous functions that allows users to pass methods as arguments
use to remove lots of boilerplate code don't need to defined return type no name no access specifier 
default methods are the methods defined in the interfaces which has body and defined with keyword default.

Byte stream works on bytes and parent of all is InputStream and output stream.
	CopyBytes uses FileInputStream and FileOutputStream.
	In CopyBytes, the int variable holds a byte value in its last 8 bits.
	Each read or write request is handled directly by the underlying OS. 
	This can make a program much less efficient, since each such request often triggers disk access, network activity, 
		or some other operation that is relatively expensive.
Character streams works on character and parent of all is Reader and Writer
	CopyCharacters uses FileReader and FileWriter
	In CopyCharacters, the int variable holds a character value in its last 16 bits
	The Java platform stores character values using Unicode conventions. 
	Each read or write request is handled directly by the underlying OS. 
	This can make a program much less efficient, since each such request often triggers disk access, network activity, 
		or some other operation that is relatively expensive.
		
To reduce  kind of overhead, the Java platform implements buffered I/O streams.
Buffered input streams read data from a memory area known as a buffer; the native input API is called only when the buffer is empty. 
Similarly, buffered output streams write data to a buffer, and the native output API is called only when the buffer is full.

A program can convert an unbuffered stream into a buffered stream using the wrapping :
inputStream = new BufferedReader(new FileReader("xanadu.txt"));
outputStream = new BufferedWriter(new FileWriter("characteroutput.txt"));

There are four buffered stream classes used to wrap unbuffered streams: 
	BufferedInputStream and BufferedOutputStream create buffered byte streams.
	BufferedReader and BufferedWriter create buffered character streams.
	
It often makes sense to write out a buffer at critical points, without waiting for it to fill. This is known as flushing the buffer.
Some buffered output classes support autoflush, specified by an optional constructor argument. When autoflush is enabled.


Data streams support binary I/O of primitive data type values (boolean, char, byte, short, int, long, float, and double) as well as String values. 
	All data streams implement either the DataInput interface or the DataOutput interface. 
	
Object Streams
	Just as data streams support I/O of primitive data types, object streams support I/O of objects.
	Most, but not all, standard classes support serialization of their objects. Those that do implement the marker interface Serializable.
	The object stream classes are ObjectInputStream and ObjectOutputStream. These classes implement ObjectInput and ObjectOutput, 
		which are sub interfaces of DataInput and DataOutput.
	That means that all the primitive data I/O methods covered in Data Streams are also implemented in object streams. 
		So an object stream can contain a mixture of primitive and object values. 
		
What Is a Glob?
	Two methods in the Files class accept a glob argument, but what is a glob?
	You can use glob syntax to specify pattern-matching behavior.
	*.html – Matches all strings that end in .html
	??? – Matches all strings with exactly three letters or digits
	*[0-9]* – Matches all strings containing a numeric value

In concurrent programming, there are two basic units of execution: processes and threads.
A computer system normally has many active processes and threads. This is true even in systems that only have a single execution core, 
	and thus only have one thread actually executing at any given moment. Processing time for a single core is shared among processes and 
	threads through an OS feature called time slicing.
	
Processes
	A process has a self-contained execution environment.
Threads
	Threads are sometimes called lightweight processes.
	
Both processes and threads provide an execution environment, but creating a new thread requires fewer resources than creating a new process.
Threads exist within a process — every process has at least one.
Threads share the process's resources, including memory and open files.
Each thread is associated with an instance of the class Thread.

Starvation
	Starvation describes a situation where a thread is unable to gain regular access to shared resources and is unable to make progress. 
	This happens when shared resources are made unavailable for long periods by "greedy" threads.
	
Livelock
	A thread often acts in response to the action of another thread. If the other thread's action is also a response to the action of another thread, 
	then livelock may result. As with deadlock, livelocked threads are unable to make further progress. However, the threads are not blocked — they are 
	simply too busy responding to each other to resume work.
	
1) Access Specifier: public, private, protected, default.
2) Access Modifier: static, abstract, final, 
			transient: transient is a variables modifier used in serialization. At the time of serialization, 
						if we don’t want to save value of a particular variable in a file, then we use transient keyword. 
						When JVM comes across transient keyword, it ignores original value of the variable and save default value of that
						variable data type.
						It is good habit to use transient keyword with private confidential fields of a class during serialization.
						  
			volatile: volatile keyword is used to modify the value of a variable by different threads.
			synchronized: use to acquire lock on the object.

SOLID: is a acronym to the five principles:
    Single responsibility: every class should have single responsibility to deal with.
    Open for extension and close for modification : mean open to enhance the model and close to modify
    Liskov principle : parent class should behave like child class.
    Interface segregation: single interface contains similar operations like dao interface should and dao related operations and service introduce should have service based operations.
    Dependency principle: should be loosely coupled.
