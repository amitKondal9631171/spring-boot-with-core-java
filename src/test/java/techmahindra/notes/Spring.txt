Spring core feature is Dependency Injection and Aspect Oriented Programing.
Spring can be used to create core projects to use Dependency Injection.

Spring Advantages:
    JDBC is simplified due to dependency injection and inversion of control.
    Spring is open source.
Spring Features:
    Inversion of control: container which takes the responsibility to initialize and manage the object life cycle.
    Aspect Oriented Programing.
    MVC
    Transaction Management
    JDBC Exception handling

Name some of the important Spring Modules?
	Some of the important Spring Framework modules are:
	Spring Context – for dependency injection.
	Spring AOP – for aspect oriented programming.
	Spring JMS – for for providing messaging service.
	Spring JDBC – for JDBC and DataSource support.
	Spring ORM – for ORM tools support such as Hibernate
	Spring Web Module – for creating web applications.

IOC container: is the mechanism to achieve loose-coupling between Objects dependencies by creating the object, wire them together and manages their life cycle.
                The container receives the instructions from the configuration. configuration can be provided by using xml
                file or annotations.
	Types of IOC:
					Bean vs application context
	Bean: Use lazy loading of beans means create beans whenever required.
	Application: use eager loading of beans.
	Application: Has more features like Internalization, Annotation based configuration.
	Bean : supports only singleton and prototype scope of bean where as Application supports Singletone, Prototype, session,
	        request type scope


Dependency Injection: is a design pattern allows us to remove the hard-coded dependencies and make our application loosely
                        coupled and manageable. Which makes application easily testable and maintainable.

    Types:
        Constructor: used for mandatory dependencies.
                    <bean id = "bulkMessageDestination" class = "org.apache.activemq.command.ActiveMQQueue">
                    	<constructor-arg value="${jms.incomingBulkMessage}" />
                    </bean>
        Setter: we can do it with @Autowire annotation on Setter or on property. Also, below is the case of xml configuration
                <bean id = "collectionOutgoingMessageSender" class = "org.springframework.jms.core.JmsTemplate">
                	<property name = "connectionFactory"><ref bean = "cachedConnectionFactory"/></property>
                	<property name = "defaultDestination" ref="collectionOutgoingMessageQueue"/>
                </bean>
        Interface


    Also, we have webapplication context which is the extension of application context and has more features related web
        applications like used to resolved themes.

Bean wiring:
    when beans are wired together by IoC container then they are called bean wiring.

Different modes of dependency injection:
    no: This is default setting which means no auto wiring. Explicit bean reference should be used for wiring.
    byName: It injects the object dependency according to name of the bean. It matches and wires its properties with the beans
            defined by the same names in the XML file.
    byType: It injects the object dependency according to type. It matches and wires a property if its type matches with exactly
            one of the beans name in XML file.
    constructor: It injects the dependency by calling the constructor of the class. It has a large number of parameters.
    autodetect: First the container tries to wire using autowire by constructor, if it can’t then it tries to autowire by byType.
    @Autowired annotation - We can use Spring @Autowired annotation for spring bean autowiring. @Autowired annotation can be applied on variables and methods for autowiring byType. We can also use @Autowired annotation on constructor for constructor based spring autowiring. For @Autowired annotation to work, we also need to enable annotation based configuration in spring bean configuration file. This can be done by context:annotation-config element or by defining a bean of type org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.AutowiredAnnotationBeanPostProcessor.
    @Qualifier annotation - This annotation is used to avoid conflicts in bean
                            mapping and we need to provide the bean name that will be used for autowiring.
                            This way we can avoid issues where multiple beans are defined for same type.
                            This annotation usually works with the @Autowired annotation.
                            For constructors with multiple arguments, we can use this annotation with the
                            argument names in the method.
Autowiring is configured by using:
    <context:annotation-config/>

@RequestMapping annotation:
    used for mapping a particular HTTP request method to a specific class/ method in controller that will be handling the respective request.
    This annotation can be applied at both levels:
        Class level : Maps the URL of the request
        Method level: Maps the URL as well as HTTP request method


Using Annotation @Autowire IoC is asked to inject the bean when eever it is required.

Spring Container----Manages---->Bean-----Defined in config file or annotation------>Classes defined with annotations/XML configuration

Servlet Container----Manages---->Servlet Classes-----Defined in config file or annotation------> implementing interface Servlet

Advantages of Spring:
	Light weight and very little overhead to use spring framework.
	Dependency injection and IoC.
	Spring works with beans.
	Spring IoC container manages the bean lifecycle.
	Spring framework is used to create Web application as well as Rest services which return xml as well as xml response.
	Support for transaction management, File upload, Java Messaging Service is with very little configuration either by Annotation or configuration file.
	
What are the new features in Spring 5?
	Spring 5 runs on Java 8+ .
	Spring Framework 5.0 comes with its own Commons Logging bridge; spring-jcl 


What is a Spring Bean?
	Any normal java class that is initialized by Spring IoC container is called Spring Bean.
	We use Spring ApplicationContext to get the Spring Bean instance.
	When we create the instance of Spring ApplicationContext, it reads the spring bean XML file and initializes all of them.
	
What are different ways to configure a class as Spring Bean?
	XML Configuration:
	Annotation
	
What are different scopes of Spring Bean?
	singleton: Only one instance of the bean will be created for each container. This is the default scope for the spring beans.
	prototype: A new instance will be created every time the bean is requested.
	request: This is same as prototype scope, however it’s meant to be used for web applications. A new instance of the bean will be created for each HTTP request.
	session: A new bean will be created for each HTTP session by the container.	
	
What is Spring Bean life cycle?
	Spring Beans are initialized by Spring Container and all the dependencies are also injected. 
	When the context is destroyed, it also destroys all the initialized beans. 
	
What is Bean wiring and @Autowired annotation?
	The process of injecting spring bean dependencies while initializing it called Spring Bean Wiring.	
	This can be done by context:annotation-config element.
	
What are different types of Spring Bean autowiring?
	There are four types of autowiring in Spring framework.
	autowire byName
	autowire byType
	autowire by constructor
	autowiring by @Autowired and @Qualifier annotations

Does Spring Bean provide thread safety?
	The default scope of Spring bean is singleton, so there will be only one instance per context.
	That means that all the having a class level variable that any thread can update will lead to inconsistent data. 
	Hence in default mode spring beans are not thread-safe.
	However, we can change spring bean scope to request, prototype
	
@Component is used to indicate that a class is a component. 	
			These classes are used for auto-detection and configured as bean when annotation based configurations are used.
			@Component
			public class RandomNameGenerator {

				public String generate() {

					var names = List.of("Peter", "Roland", "Lucy", "Robert", "Jane");

					var r = new Random();
					int i = r.nextInt(names.size());

					return names.get(i);
				}
			}	
				
@Controller is a specific type of component, 
			used in MVC applications and mostly used to handle http requests with RequestMapping annotation.
@Repository annotation is used to indicate that a component is used as repository and a mechanism to store/retrieve/search data.
@Service is used to indicate that the class is holding the business logic.

As a conclusion, it's always a good idea to choose the annotation-based on their layer conventions.
			
What is DispatcherServlet and ContextLoaderListener?
	DispatcherServlet is the front controller in the Spring MVC application and it loads the spring bean configuration file and initialize all 
	the beans that are configured.
	If annotations are enabled, it also scans the packages and configure any bean annotated with 
	@Component, @Controller, @Repository or @Service annotations.
	
ContextLoaderListener: loads the different context files and work to manage the
                        applicant context lifecycle. It is defined in the Web.xml

What is ViewResolver in Spring?
	ViewResolver implementations are used to resolve the view pages by name. 
	
How to handle exceptions in Spring MVC Framework?
	Spring MVC Framework provides the following ways to help us achieving robust exception handling.
	Controller Based – We can define exception handler methods in our controller classes. All we need is to annotate these methods
	with @ExceptionHandler annotation.
	Global Exception Handler – Exception Handling is a cross-cutting concern and Spring provides @ControllerAdvice annotation that we can use with any class to define our global exception handler.

How to create ApplicationContext in a Java Program?
	There are following ways to create spring context in a standalone java program.
		AnnotationConfigApplicationContext: If we are using Spring in standalone java applications and using annotations for Configuration,
			then we can use this to initialize the container and get the bean objects.
		ClassPathXmlApplicationContext: If we have spring bean configuration xml file in standalone application, then we can use this class to
			load the file and get the container object.
		FileSystemXmlApplicationContext: This is similar to ClassPathXmlApplicationContext except that the xml configuration file can be 
			loaded from anywhere in the file system.
			
What are the minimum configurations needed to create Spring MVC application?
	Add spring-context and spring-webmvc dependencies in the project.
	Configure DispatcherServlet in the web.xml file to handle requests through spring container.
	Spring bean configuration file to define beans.
	Controller class with request mappings defined to handle the client requests.

Spring Transaction Management:
	Need to define the transaction bean by assign the sessionfactory bean then using @Transaction annotation.
	
DB indexes are used to increase the performance to fetch data from database.
	Types of Indexes: 
		Clustered:which sorts the data on there primary key values. There is only one clustered index on a single table.
