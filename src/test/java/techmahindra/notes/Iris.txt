Immutable class:
    Make class as final.
    declare mutable fields as final
    only getters to get the values and don't expose setter to set the value.
    When exposing methods which modify the state of the class, you must always return a new instance of the class.
    If the class holds the mutable object:
        --> Inside the constructor to initialize the object use deep copy of mutable object.

Generics:
    promises the type safety for row type of collection. Before generics there was an issue with collections as we can store different
    type of objects in collection and if don't type cast the properly while iterating the collection then we will get type cast exception.
    Types:
        Generic Class
        Generic Methods
    WildCard: ? is defined as wildcard which defines collection can have any type of entry means used to make methods generics
