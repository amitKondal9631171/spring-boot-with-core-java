Heap area is one of the most important memory areas of JVM.
    Here, all the java objects are stored. The heap is created when the JVM starts.
    The heap is generally divided into two parts.
    That is:
        1. Young Generation: All the new objects are allocated in this memory.
                             Whenever this memory gets filled, the garbage collection is
                             performed. This is called as Minor Garbage Collection.
        2. Old Generation: All the long lived objects which have survived many rounds of
                            minor garbage collection is stored in this area. Whenever this
                            memory gets filled, the garbage collection is performed.
                            This is called as Major Garbage Collection.

Apart from the heap memory, JVM also contains another type of memory which is called
        as Permanent Generation or "PermGen".
        PermGen Memory: This is a special space in java heap which is separated from the
                        main memory where all the static content is stored in this section.
        The biggest disadvantage of PermGen is that it contains a limited size which leads
            to an OutOfMemoryError.

        The default size of PermGen memory is 64 MB on 32-bit JVM and 82 MB on the 64-bit version
        Due to this, JVM had to change the size of this memory by frequently performing
            Garbage collection which is a costly operation.

         Java also allows to manually change the size of the PermGen memory.
         However, the PermGen space cannot be made to auto increase.
         So, it is difficult to tune it. And also, the garbage collector is
         not efficient enough to clean the memory.

         Due to the above problems, PermGen has been completely removed in Java 8.
         In the place of PermGen, a new feature called Meta Space has been introduced.
         MetaSpace grows automatically by default. Here, the garbage collection is
         automatically triggered when the class metadata usage reaches its maximum
         metaspace size.



Method Area is a part of space in the PermGen and it is used to store the
        class structure and the code for methods and constructors.
