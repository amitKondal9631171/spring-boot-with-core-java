Heap area is one of the most important memory areas of JVM.
    Here, all the java objects are stored. The heap is created when the JVM starts.
    The heap is generally divided into two parts.
    That is:
        1. Young Generation: All the new objects are allocated in this memory.
                             Whenever this memory gets filled, the garbage collection is
                             performed. This is called as Minor Garbage Collection.
        2. Old Generation: All the long lived objects which have survived many rounds of
                            minor garbage collection is stored in this area. Whenever this
                            memory gets filled, the garbage collection is performed.
                            This is called as Major Garbage Collection.
