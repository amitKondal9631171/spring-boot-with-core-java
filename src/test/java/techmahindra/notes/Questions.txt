Maven:
	maven compile vs install
	what are the phases in maven

Hibernate:
	Criteria
	Projection
	Restrictions
	Cache

Java:
	order on entity : comparable and comparator also write lambda expression for this
	Interface default method multiple inheritance:
			need to override default method which have same signature in parent interfaces and give the funtionality.
			In overridden method we can call the parent method by using: ParentClass.super.method();
	HashMap implementation
	Mockito
	RestControllers, GetMapping, PostMapping, RequestBody
	How to Create an immutable class in Java?
		To create an immutable class in Java, you have to do the following steps.
		Declare the class as final so it can’t be extended.
		Make all fields private so that direct access is not allowed.
		Don’t provide setter methods for variables.
		Make all mutable fields final so that its value can be assigned only once.
		Initialize all the fields via a constructor performing deep copy.
		Perform cloning of objects in the getter methods to return a copy rather than returning the actual object reference.
			
Spring-Hibernate Connection:
	1) Define datasource
	2) Inject data source to Hibernate session factory with all hbm mapped objects.
	3) session factory to Hibernate transaction manager.
	
Active MQ:
	1) Active mq is a JMS client used to handle the messaging services.
	2) Queue: add the messages in the queue which are consumed by the consumers for the queue. It is one to one connection 
				means single producer will have single consumer.
    3) Topic: messages will be added to the queue and will be handled by the number of configured consumers.
			  Topic queue will be consumed by the multiple configured subscriber.
	4) Synchronous/Asynchronous: messages will be added to the queue by using Syn/Asynchronous. In Syn mode producer will wait for the ack send by the consumer.
								 In Asynchronous no ack will be send back by the consumer. used for fast processing.
	5) Configuration:
		i) connection with active mq
		ii) inject connection into jms template
		iii) configure queue with the jms template.
		iv) write queue listener to listen the queue.
		v) Adaptor to convert the request to object
		v) Create channels
		    --> Error Channel handle errors
			--> Message processor: to convert the request json to object.
	6) we are using default open wire protocol for active mq messaging.

A Java Classloader is of three types:
	BootStrap ClassLoader: A Bootstrap Classloader is a Machine code which kick starts the operation when the JVM calls it.
							It is not a java class. Its job is to load the first pure Java ClassLoader. Bootstrap ClassLoader loads 
							classes from the location rt.jar. Bootstrap ClassLoader does’t have any parent ClassLoaders.
							It is also called as the Primordial ClassLoader.
	Extension ClassLoader: The Extension ClassLoader is a child of Bootstrap ClassLoader and loads the extensions of core java classes from the 
							respective JDK Extension library. It loads files from jre/lib/ext directory or any other directory pointed by the 
							system property java.ext.dirs.
	System/Application ClassLoader: It loads the Application type classes found in the environment
						variable CLASSPATH, -classpath or -cp command line option. The Application ClassLoader is a child class of 
						Extension ClassLoader.
