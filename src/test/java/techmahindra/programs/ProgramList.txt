1) Oops program for overload,override constructor over load.


Oops points: 1) If class A is extended by B and B is extended by C also A and B has the overridden function but C don't have
                any overridden function. Now we are creating Object of C with is being referred by A. A anc C don't have any connection
                but c is a sub class of B and B is sub class of A so indirectly C is a subclass of A... Now A is referred to Object c and
                method is being called by reference A so it will call method of B class because B is super class of C and always child class
                function is called first as C don't have that function so B's function will be called...
