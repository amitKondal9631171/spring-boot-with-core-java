Java inner or nested classes are classes which are declared inside the class.
We use inner classes to logically group classes and interfaces in one place so that they can be easily readable and maintainable.
Inner classes can access all the members and methods of outer class.


Types:
Member Inner Class:	A class created within class and outside method.
Static Nested Class: A static class created within class.
Anonymous Inner Class:	A class created for implementing interface or extending class.
                        Its name is decided by the java compiler.
Local Inner Class:	A class created within method.
Nested Interface:	An interface created within class or interface.
