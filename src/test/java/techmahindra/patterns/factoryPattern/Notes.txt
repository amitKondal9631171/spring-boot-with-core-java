1️⃣ What is the Factory Design Pattern?
    The Factory Design Pattern is a creational design pattern that hides object creation logic from the client.
    Instead of creating objects using the new keyword directly, you delegate the creation process to a factory class or method.


    | **Drawback**         | **Impact**                            |
    | -------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
    | Increased complexity | Adds boilerplate for simple creations |
    | Harder maintenance   | Frequent modifications for new types  |
    | Tight coupling       | Factory changes ripple to client code |
    | Testing overhead     | Requires mocks for testing            |
    | Performance hit      | Slight overhead in creation           |
    | Limited flexibility  | Without DI or advanced patterns       |
    | Overuse risk         | Leads to over-engineering             |


When to Avoid Factory Pattern
    When object creation is simple and unlikely to change.
    When the system doesn’t need loose coupling for object instantiation.
    In small projects where clarity and simplicity are more valuable than extensibility.
