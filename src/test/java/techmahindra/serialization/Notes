Serialization is a mechanism of converting the state of an object into a byte stream.
This mechanism is used to persist the object.
Case 1: If superclass is serializable then subclass is automatically serializable automatically.
Case 2: If super class is serializable and subclass is not and don't want to serialize sub class then need to override
        readObject and writeObject method to throw serializable exception.
Case 3: If Sub class implements serializable interface and parent is not then jvm will not serialize parent class object
          but need default constructor during deserialization.
Association:If a class has a reference to another class, all the references must be Serializable otherwise serialization process will
                not be performed. In such case, NotSerializableException is thrown at runtime.

What’s wrong with the default serialVersionUID?
If no serialVersionUID is declared, JVM will use its own algorithm to generate a default SerialVersionUID,
    you can check the algorithm here.

The default serialVersionUID computation is highly sensitive to class details
    and may vary from different JVM implementation,
    and result in an unexpected InvalidClassExceptions during the deserialization process.


The ObjectOutputStream class is used to write primitive data types, and Java objects to an OutputStream.
    Only objects that support the java.io.Serializable interface can be written to streams.
