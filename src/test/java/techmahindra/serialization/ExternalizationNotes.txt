Externalization is Serialization using Externalize interface instead of Serializable.
The externalize interface itself extends Serializable interface and has two methods: readExternal and writeExternal.
These 2 methods give complete control over format and contents that you want to Serialize/deserialize and must be
    implemented by the class.

How to do Externalization :
    1. The class must implement Externalize interface and override readExternal and writeExternal methods.
    2. Inside writeExternal method, write the variables to stream/file using proper methods of ObjectOutput, like writeInt() for int and writeObject for objects, strings etc.
    3. Similarly, while deserializing use the proper method of ObjectInput, inside readExternal method.
    4. Rest of steps are same as Serialization, like creating ObjectOutputStream and invoking writeObject.

 When an Externalizable object is reconstructed, a new instance is created using the public no-arg constructor of the
     externalization class and then the readExternal method is invoked to restore the state.
     That means the externalization class must have a public non-arg constructor.
    Otherwise following exception will be thrown InvalidClassException .
