divide-and-conquer programming approach:
    In divide and conquer approach, the problem in hand, is divided into smaller
    sub-problems and then each problem is solved independently. When we keep on dividing the sub problems into even
    smaller sub-problems, we may eventually reach a stage where no more division is possible.
    Those "atomic" smallest possible sub-problem (fractions) are solved.

Dynamic programming approach: is similar to divide and conquer in breaking down the problem into smaller
                              and yet smaller possible sub-problems.
                              But unlike, divide and conquer, these sub-problems are not solved independently.
Rather, results of these smaller sub-problems are remembered and used for similar or overlapping sub-problems.
Dynamic programming is used where we have problems, which can be divided into similar sub-problems, so that their results can be re-used.

The following computer problems can be solved using dynamic programming approach −

Data Object: Data Object represents an object having a data.
Data Type: Data type is a way to classify various types of data such as integer, string, etc.
Types of Data Type:
    Built-in Data Type : Those data types for which a language has built-in support are known as Built-in Data types.
                        For example, most of the languages provide the following built-in data types:
                        Integers
                        Boolean (true, false)
                        Floating (Decimal numbers)
                        Character and Strings
    Derived Data Type: Which are implemented by the user by using built-in data types.
                        For example −
                        List
                        Array
                        Stack
                        Queue
Basic Operations:
  The data in the data structures are processed by certain operations.
  The particular data structure chosen largely depends on the frequency of the operation that needs to be performed on the data structure.
      Insertion
      Updation
      deletion
      search
      traverse
      sorting

Linear search is a very simple search algorithm. In this type of search, a sequential search is
    made over all items one by one.
    Every item is checked and if a match is found then that particular item is returned, otherwise the search continues till the end
    of the data collection.
