Sorting Efficiency:
The two main criteria to judge which algorithm is better than the other have been:
    Time taken to sort the given data.
    Memory Space required to do so.


Different Sorting Algorithms
There are many different techniques available for sorting, differentiated by their efficiency and space requirements.
    Following are some sorting techniques which we will be covering in next few tutorials.
        Bubble Sort : compare the elements with one by one.
        Insertion Sort
        Selection Sort : select the lowest value from array and replace with starting value.
        Quick Sort
        Merge Sort: Merge Sort follows the rule of Divide and Conquer to sort a given set of numbers/elements, recursively, hence
                    consuming less time. Selection Sort and Insertion Sort, both of which
                    have a worst-case running time of O(n2). As the size of input grows, insertion and selection sort can take a long
                    time to run. Merge sort , on the other hand, runs in O(n*log n) time in all the cases.
        Heap Sort

The time complexity of:
    Merge sort is always O(n log n),
    Quicksort varies between O(n log n) in the best case to O(n2) in the worst case.
