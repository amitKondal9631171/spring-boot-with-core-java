What is garbage collection in java?
    Garbage collection is the process of identifying used and unused objects on java heap and removing
    unused object from the heap.
    A live object means object is still being referred to some part of program.
    Unused object means object is not being referred by any part of program and is eligible for garbage collection.
    Programmer does not have to do manual garbage collection like C or C++. JAVA TAKES CARE OF :)

What is difference between Collection.synchronizedMap(map) and ConcurrentHashMap?
    When you make map thread safe by using Collection.synchronizedMap(map), it locks whole map object.
    ConcurrentHashMap does not lock the whole map, it just locks part of it(Segment).

Which design pattern you have used in your project?
    You can name few design patterns such as Singleton, Observer etc. which you might have used in your project.

What is double level locking in singleton design pattern?
     public static Singleton getInstance()
     	{
     		if (_instance == null) { // Single Checked
     		    //T2 is waiting here after checking that object exist or not.
     			synchronized (Singleton.class)
     			{
     			//T1 is inside the block and creating object..now T1 creates object while t2 is waiting and now t2 aquire the lock in this case t2 will again check for null.
     			//so that it will make sure the while he was waiting no other thread has created the object.
     				if (_instance == null)// Double checked

     				{
     					_instance = new Singleton();
     				}
     			}
     		} return _instance;
     	}

     Let’s say two threads(T1 and T2) checked for null and both reached at synchronized (Singleton.class) .
     T1 gets the lock and create instance of Singleton and return.Now T2 enters in synchronized block, as we
     have checked for null again,it will not create object again.

Have you worked on Java 8? Can you share major changes in Java 8?
